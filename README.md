# Inference_and_Regression_Workshop
This is a presentation I put together for the R&amp;D team highlighting the common pitfalls of classical inference and regression.

I tried to highlight the interplay between sample size, effect size, and test noise on the power of a basic t-test using simulations pulling from a known underlying population.  I also laid out the fundamentals of bivariate regression analysis and the importance of residual diagnostics.  I'm including the powerpoint slide deck (I'm working on transcribing it to Slidify or something else easily viewable) and the R code that I wrote for the simulations and plots.  The other plots in the presentation were either pulled from the web or generated in JMP.
